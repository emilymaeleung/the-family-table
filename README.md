# the-family-table

For this assignement, I was tasked with creating a website based off of the wireframe that I created in session.

WIREFRAME: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N85bSn9HYMoEPU7eqAmA5r3YTUd-nMVP2HkM6p98lHw/edit?usp=sharing

I also had to make sure that I utilised CSS variables, flexbo, psuedo elements and created 3 separate pages that you can navigate to from the menu.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and can see how much my coding skills have developed from last week.

The things I struggled with most was the footer, as it took a while to figure out how to utilise flex in different directions, and the pseudo elements on the contact form - as I forgot how to do them and had to revisit my notes.

Things I couldn't figure out:

How to make padding-left in banner text responsive. 19% looks good on desktop, but too much on mobile
Feature-white on about.htm isn't responsive, there is something from my css that is causing this
